# Q: What did Pandawa feel when they won Mahabharata? 

> A devotee does not carry an independent reason to feel elated separate from the desire of God. Pandavas were happy to act according to the desire of the Supreme Lord. 
> However, in Srimad Bhagavatam (https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/1/8/48), Yudhisthira takes the responsibility of massacre upon himself and then got pacified by Bhishma.

Biswas, Partha

# Q: After getting assignments, I remember the concept of virtualisation in the CPU: I have two assignments from two professors, how do I make the professors think I have two brains, one for each?

> I don't know.
