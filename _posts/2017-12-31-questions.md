# Q: What did Pandawa feel when they won Mahabharata? 

> A devotee does not carry an independent reason to feel elated separate from the desire of God. Pandavas were happy to act according to the desire of the Supreme Lord. 
> However, in Srimad Bhagavatam (https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/1/8/48), Yudhisthira takes the responsibility of massacre upon himself and then got pacified by Bhishma.

Biswas, Partha
