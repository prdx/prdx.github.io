Hi there!

This is me Bagus and this will be my personal blog. 

Initially I wanted to be geeky and call this blog my `/dev/null`, however I found the name is not correct. This is not my `/dev/null`. 

Then, I move on to another geeky terms, so it sounds cool. I wanted to name this blog as my `null space`. But then it is not also correct. What I add to this blog, does change me.

Being lazy, in the end, I will just call this my `personal blog` instead.
