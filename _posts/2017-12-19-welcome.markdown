Hi there!

This is me: Bagus, and this will be my personal blog. 

Initially I wanted to be geeky and call this blog my [/dev/null](https://askubuntu.com/q/12098), however I found the name is not correct. This is not my `/dev/null`. 

Then, I moved on to another geeky terms. I wanted to be cool nerd, if that exists. I named this blog as my [null space](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/21131/475524). But then, it is not also correct. What I add as a content of this blog, does change me.

Being lazy, in the end, I will just call this my `personal blog` instead.
