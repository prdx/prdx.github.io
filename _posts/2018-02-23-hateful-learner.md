_Ideas_

In my home country, Indonesia, there are people who spread articles on the internet, especially in the name of the religion. Not only this problem brings negative sentiments toward the religion itself but also it has a bad impact to a young generation in Indonesia. Last year, there was a video about kids shouting “Kill Ahok!”. Ahok is ex-Jakarta governor who was jailed because of his controversial speech and the speech has been seen as blasphemous, thus reported to police. To prevent these hateful comments spreading further in our young generation, I plan to utilize the power of neural network together with natural language processing to censor a hateful comments or articles. This idea then can be implemented as a browser plugin. Combining with active learning, we can use the help for the society to label the new articles and train our model using these new articles. Thus making our model better in the future.
