My name is Bagus. Pronounced as `BAH-gus TRI-HAT-MA-JA`.

My goal is to improve the way we process the data. 

In this era where data is ubiquitous, I want to understand how we can build a system that can handle and process high amount of data. I plan not only improve the machine learning methods itself but also I want to improve from application, operating system, and hardware levels.

Outside of studying, I enjoy myself reading science or historical fiction novels and sometimes non-fiction. Some of my life-time favourites are: Dune, 1984, Gandhi The Man, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. I also like cycling and admire its technology. For me, bicycle is the most efficient machine and improving it to be even more efficient is an interesting topic to discuss.

I found myself enjoying teaching as well. I would try my best to study, so that I can teach my friends. Oftentimes, I do that voluntarily. I feel, if I can explain something in a simple way, that means I understand the subject well enough.

I am playing many roles:
1. I am a graduate student at [Northeastern University](https://ccis.northeastern.edu)
2. Fulbright scholar
3. Cat
