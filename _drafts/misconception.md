During my night walk, I realized I have changed. Not only physically but also mentally changed. My perspective have shifted a lot.

Let me explain of how I develop this idea of myself:

**2007 - 2009:**

I used to think I am a natural leader. I enjoyed the idea that becoming a leader in a group is cool. I forced myself to become a leader. Whenever there was an election, I will be the first one who raised my hand.
During my high-school, I became a leader in a mountaineering group. Twice. I enjoyed being a central of attention during this period. 

In that group as well, I used to think, with "military training", would make us not only mentally stronger but also physically stronger. Yes, I was used to be bullied and bully people. Although, during that time, I don't consider myself being bullied or bully, rather I was following the dogma planted
from a generation to another that those bullies are part of the training. That it made us stronger. There was a time, we are forced to do push-up, in field, when the sun is right above us. The temperature I think was around 30 degree Celcius. My friends' palm got burned because of that. Yet the reason 
we are given was: "Imagine yourself doing a rock climbing under the same temperature, do you think the rock is hot or cool? You are prepared for that."

**2009 - 2013:**

This is college period. The idea of me being a leader faded gradually until 2013. Although, I still led some projects and events, and made sure they were successful. Which they did. I still carried some dogma from my high-school until at the end of my study, I thought those dogma are useless. People
can be changed or trained without violence or bullying. 

I broke up with during this period as well, which I consider one of the most significant point in my life that changed my perspective. I learned that I have made so many mistakes. I held the unhealthy relationship too long. That I should just let it go if that is not good for me, instead of trying to be keep it.
In the end, it is just like holding sand with your hand. The stronger you hold the sand, the more sand coming out from the holes between your fingers.

**2013 - 2014:**

I didn't have any problem finding my first job. The job was trusted to me by my professor before I graduated. Which is great, I didn't have to look for a job. I moved to the city and I earned relatively well as well. Then, I felt I need to refresh. 
So, I decided to quit. After quitting from my first job, I did my solo travel to Flores. I met many people and thought a lot about what I actually want to do. Even though during the trip I did so much self-reflection, I still have the idea that I could achieve anything that I want.
The idea existed until I got rejections from companies that I applied.

**2014 - 2015:**

Keep getting rejected by big companies, I decided to take freelance jobs. Apparently it went well, although it took time to get my first client. After several months doing freelance job, I got invitation from a start-up in Bali.
Which later became, one of the best moment in my career and brought me to my next relationship. In this period I learnt to be patient.
